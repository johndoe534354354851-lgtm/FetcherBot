# Fetcher Bot

**The evolution of [Midnight Fetcher Bot](https://github.com/ADA-Markets/midnight-fetcher-bot) - now supporting multiple mining projects!**

APPLICATION BROUGHT TO YOU BY PADDY https://x.com/PoolShamrock AND PAUL https://x.com/cwpaulm

A multi-project mining platform that supports any project following a similar mining process to the Midnight Scavenger Mine (pulling challenges from an API, finding solutions, and submitting them). Built with NextJS and runs on both Windows and Linux.

**Supported Projects:**
- **Defensio** - DFO token mining
- More projects coming soon!

When the app starts, it can take 5 - 10 minutes for things to fully get going the first time as the script instalkls all prerequisites. Address registration can take some time due to API rate limiting, but this is a one-time thing per project.

This software was built at the community's request to help simplify API mining and make it accessible to anyone who wants to get involved. It is released as-is. Use at your own risk and do your own due diligence on any projects you choose to mine - the authors take no responsibility for any issues that may arise.

## Features

- 🔄 **Multi-Project Support** - Switch between different mining projects easily
- 🔐 **Easy Wallet Creation** - Generate 24-word seed phrase with one click
- 💼 **200 Mining Addresses** - Auto-generate and register addresses per project
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly UI** - Modern web interface with real-time updates
- ⚡ **Native Performance** - Rust-based hashing for maximum speed
- 🪟 **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows and Linux
- 📊 **Live Dashboard** - Real-time mining statistics and solution tracking
- 📦 **Consolidation** - Consolidate rewards from multiple addresses

## Development Fee

This software includes a small development fee to support ongoing maintenance and improvements.
- **1 in every 15 solutions** (~6.67%) is mined for the developers
- This is **not a fee on your rewards** - you keep all your mined solutions
- Completely transparent - dev fee solutions are clearly logged and marked separately
- Can be disabled in the Settings tab of the mining dashboard

## Quick Start

### Windows Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- Windows 10/11
- Internet connection
- Git (optional but recommended for easy updates)

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository** (recommended) or download ZIP:
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/ADA-Markets/FetcherBot.git
   cd FetcherBot
   ```

2. **Run Setup** - Double-click `setup.cmd` or open Command Prompt and run:
   ```cmd
   setup.cmd
   ```

3. The setup script will:
   - ✅ Check/install Node.js 20.x
   - ✅ Verify pre-built hash server
   - ✅ Install all dependencies

   ```

### Ubuntu/Linux Server Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- Ubuntu 20.04+ (or compatible Linux distribution)

   cd FetcherBot
   ```

   Or download ZIP if git is not available:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/ADA-Markets/FetcherBot/archive/main.zip
   unzip main.zip
   cd FetcherBot-main
   ```

2. **Run initial setup** (first time only):

   ```
   http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3001
   ```

   Services are running in the background - no need to press Ctrl+C!

4. **Manage services** (after initial setup):
   ```bash
   ./start.sh        # Start services (auto-detects CPU cores)
   ./start.sh 16     # Start with 16 worker threads
   ./stop.sh         # Stop all services
   ./status.sh       # Check if services are running
   ./logs.sh         # View live logs
   ```

   **CPU Thread Configuration:** Scripts auto-detect all available CPU cores.
   Override with: `./start.sh 24` or `WORKERS=24 ./start.sh`

5. **Update to latest version** (when updates are released):
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh                    # Stop services first
   git pull                     # Pull latest changes
   ./setup.sh                   # Rebuild (or ./start.sh if no hash engine changes)
   ```

**Firewall Configuration** (if needed):
```bash
sudo ufw allow 3001/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

## Usage

Run: setup.cmd

On Complete navigate on browser to

http://localhost:3001

### First Time Setup

1. **Create Wallet**
   - Click "Create New Wallet"

## Dashboard Features

### Real-Time Stats
- 🎯 **Challenge ID** - Current mining challenge
- ✅ **Solutions Found** - Total solutions submitted
- ⏱️ **Uptime** - Mining session duration
- 📍 **Registered Addresses** - 200 addresses ready to mine
- 📈 **Hash Rate** - Mining performance

### Controls
- ▶️ **Start Mining** - Begin mining operation
- ⏹️ **Stop Mining** - Stop current mining session
- 🔄 **Live Updates** - Real-time statistics via Server-Sent Events

## Security

### Wallet Security
- Seed phrase encrypted with password (scrypt + AES-256-GCM)
- Encrypted files stored in `secure/` directory
- Never shares seed phrase after initial display
- All signing done locally (no network transmission of keys)

### Best Practices
- ✅ Use a strong password (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- ✅ Store seed phrase offline (paper, hardware wallet)
- ✅ Never share your seed phrase with anyone
- ✅ Backup your `secure/` directory to external storage
- ❌ Never screenshot or digitally store your seed phrase

### Scale
increase the below in lib\mining\orchestrator.ts
const BATCH_SIZE = 350;
private workerThreads = 12;

increase or decrease these based on your hardware 

## Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues

**"Node.js not found"**
- Run `setup.cmd` - it will guide you to install Node.js
- Or manually install from: https://nodejs.org/

**"Rust not found"**
- Run `setup.cmd` - it will install Rust automatically
- Or manually install from: https://rustup.rs/

**"Native module build failed"**
- Ensure Visual C++ Build Tools are installed
- Rust installer should handle this automatically
- Restart your terminal after Rust installation

### Runtime Issues

**"Failed to decrypt wallet"**
- Double-check your password
- Ensure `secure/wallet-seed.json.enc` exists

**"Address registration failing"**
- Check your internet connection
- API may be rate-limiting (waits 1.5s between registrations)
- Check logs in `logs/` directory

**"Mining not starting"**
- Ensure all 200 addresses are registered
- Check if challenge is active (mining has time windows)
- Verify ROM initialization completed

## Project Profiles

The application supports multiple mining projects through profiles. Profiles are fetched from a remote API and cached locally.

### Selecting a Project
1. On first launch, you'll be prompted to select a project
2. Projects can be switched from the profile selection page
3. Each project maintains separate wallet and mining data

### Profile Configuration
Each project profile contains:
- API endpoints for mining
- Token information (ticker, decimals)
- Branding and display settings
- Feature flags (consolidation, diagnostics)

Built-in profiles are stored in `lib/profiles/` and custom profiles can be added to `Documents/FetcherBot/profiles/`.

## Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use this on multiple computers?**
A: Yes, copy your `Documents/FetcherBot/projects/{project}/secure/` directory and use your password on the new machine.

**Q: What happens if I forget my password?**
A: You'll need your 24-word seed phrase to recover. Without it, the wallet is unrecoverable.

**Q: Can I change the number of addresses?**
A: Yes, modify `count` in the wallet creation request (default: 200, max: 500).

**Q: Is my seed phrase sent to the server?**
A: No. All wallet operations are local. Only public addresses and signatures are sent to the mining API.

### Logs

Check these locations for debugging:
- `logs/app.log` - Application logs
- `logs/wallet-registration-progress.log` - Address registration status
- Console output in terminal
